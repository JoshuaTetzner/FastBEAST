The procedure is as follows: At first there are k points chosen from the dataset as centers. Then each point is sorted to its closest center. For each resulting cluster the center is recalculated by its points and all points are resorted to the new centers. This step is repeated for a given number of iterations. The whole process is alternately repeated for each cluster.

By default the wrapped ParallelKMeans.jl algorithm is used, which stops iterating when the new center of a cluster is close enough to the last iteration. This prevents unnecessary iterations and thus reduces the required computing time. For non homogenous distributions equal sized clusters can not always be reached, but more iterations will generate in general a better tree structure for the algorithms in this package. For the the algorithms in this package 100 iterations and two children for each level are recommended.","category":"page"},{"location":"man/aca/#Adaptive-Cross-Aproximation","page":"Adaptive Cross Aproximation","title":"Adaptive Cross Aproximation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#FastBEAST.jl","page":"Home","title":"FastBEAST.jl","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Some ideas for implementing an ACA in Julia targeting BEAST.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Package-Features","page":"Home","title":"Package Features","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Fast linear Algebra","category":"page"},{"location":"#Example","page":"Home","title":"Example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Example of the main feature of the package.","category":"page"}]
